# DevOps Final Project

## Overview
This project is a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for a Flask web application. The pipeline is built using GitHub Actions, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, and various monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. The main goal of the project is to create a seamless deployment process for a microservices-based web application, ensuring reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

This project also incorporates best practices for infrastructure automation, security scanning, and performance monitoring. By leveraging cloud-native technologies, we ensure efficient resource utilization and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the pipeline integrates security tools to detect vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

## Features
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline** using GitHub Actions, streamlining deployment from development to production.
- **Containerized Application** using Docker, allowing for efficient application packaging and execution in isolated environments.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform, automating cloud infrastructure provisioning and management.
- **Kubernetes Deployment** managed with Helm, simplifying the deployment of complex applications.
- **Monitoring and Logging** using Prometheus and Grafana, providing real-time insights into system health.
- **Unit Testing and Security Scans** integrated in the CI/CD workflow to ensure code quality and application security.
- **Automated Scaling and Load Balancing**, ensuring high availability and performance under varying workloads.
- **Secret Management** using Kubernetes secrets and environment variables, enhancing security and compliance.
- **Database Management** with Terraform and Kubernetes, allowing automated provisioning and configuration of relational databases.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for building REST APIs.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application, ensuring portability and consistency.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates and manages containerized applications across clusters.
- **Helm**: Simplifies Kubernetes deployments using Helm charts.
- **Terraform**: Automates infrastructure provisioning, including compute, networking, and storage.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization tools for system metrics and alerts.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline, executing tasks such as linting, testing, and deployment.
- **pytest**: Runs unit tests to validate application functionality.
- **AWS**: Cloud service provider for deploying infrastructure and hosting the application.

## CI/CD Pipeline Breakdown
The CI/CD pipeline automates the entire deployment workflow from code commit to production deployment, ensuring efficiency and reliability.

### Steps in the Pipeline:
1. **Code Linting**
   - Runs Flake8 and Bandit for security and style checks, preventing code vulnerabilities and ensuring maintainability.

2. **Static Code Analysis**
   - Uses SonarQube to analyze code quality and detect issues before deployment.

3. **Unit Testing**
   - Runs pytest to execute test cases and ensure application correctness.

4. **Build and Push Docker Image**
   - Creates a Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub, allowing efficient deployment.

5. **Deploy to Kubernetes**
   - Uses Helm to deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster, managing configurations and version control.

6. **Infrastructure Deployment**
   - Terraform provisions cloud resources such as compute instances, storage, networking, and Kubernetes clusters.

7. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Deploys Prometheus and Grafana for real-time system monitoring, collecting and visualizing performance metrics.

8. **Security and Compliance**
   - Scans the application and container images for vulnerabilities using security tools.

9. **Automated Rollback**
   - Implements rollback mechanisms in case of a failed deployment to ensure system stability.

10. **Notifications**
   - Sends alerts to Slack or email notifications on build success or failure, improving team collaboration.

## Monitoring Setup
After deployment, Grafana and Prometheus dashboards provide real-time insights into system performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full DevOps pipeline, integrating automation, testing, security, monitoring, and cloud infrastructure management. The structured approach ensures high availability, scalability, and maintainability of the application. By leveraging cloud technologies and best DevOps practices, the system can handle increased demand, minimize downtime, and improve overall reliability. The architecture is built with extensibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements and integrations.
